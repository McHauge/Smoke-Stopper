Designed to stop the magic smoke from escaping when testing drones.

Primary editor: McHauge

Current version: 	V8.1 - Swaps some components with some of a cheaper type resulting in
about 2,5 EUR cheaper in just raw component cost, also gets a more responsive and smaller 
push button for reseting, together with a more solid on/off slider.

Beta Version:	V9 - Layout more production friendly and in a smaller form factor.



---- Earlier Versions ----

version V7.0 and V7.1 - With better polarity protection than V6.0, 
this meaning it will protect if the power into the input is wrong it will protect, 
but if the polarity error is after this unit then this will not protect before it trips.

version V6.0 - Tested and working, first stable version that would allow motor idling.

version V5.0 - First version to work but would not allow the drone to start up.

version V1.0-V4.0 - doesn't work as intended, does nothing, burns, or wont turn of again.
